# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported versions of MicrobeTrace are always the versions under the latest minor release. A Minor release bump signals
sunsetting of security support for older versions. Most users will not ever need to worry about this, as they'll be served the
newest production-released version of MicrobeTrace by default.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 0.5   | :x:                |
| [MicrobeTrace Desktop](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace-archive) | :x:   |
| WinHIVTRACE | :x:   |

Historical projects from which MicrobeTrace has evolved are NOT supported. Anyone using these is strongly encouraged to begin
using [MicrobeTrace](https://microbetrace.herokuapp.com/) instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in MicrobeTrace, please detail it in an email to microbetrace@cdc.gov. Please DO NOT file an
issue report on Github. We'll get back to you within two business days. During those two days, we'll attempt to verify the
vulnerability you're reporting, so we can respond to confirm or deny the validity of your report. If your report is confirmed,
we'll write and release a patch as quickly as we possibly can.
